Welcome to GameHub, the universe of games. This project is a culmination of my first months of learning, and I aimed to create an informative, easy-to-navigate, and intuitive gaming website that captures the "universe" aspect within every pixel.

## Description

- **Informative**: Each page is a trove of gaming details, from latest releases to timeless classics.
- **Navigable**: A clear layout and intuitive design guide users through a seamless journey.

- **Aesthetic**: Drawing inspiration from the vastness of the universe, the design echoes the depth and wonder of space.
